This Power BI dashboard is part of my **20-Day Dashboard Challenge**. It analyzes dummy social media data to simulate user behavior and engagement across various demographics and content types.

## 📌 Objective

To understand how users interact with content through likes, shares, comments, and video views based on their **age, gender, profession, country, and hobbies**.

The dashboard demonstrates how businesses can derive actionable insights from social engagement data to enhance targeting and content strategies.
