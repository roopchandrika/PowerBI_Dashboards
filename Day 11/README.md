# Ocean and Marine Life Analysis Dashboard (2015–2023)

This dashboard is part of my **20-Day Power BI Dashboarding Challenge (Day 11)**.  
It visualizes marine ecosystem data — including sea surface temperatures, pH levels, bleaching severity, and species observations — across key oceanic regions from 2015 to 2023.

---

## 🌊 Dataset Overview

This dataset simulates realistic measurements from global marine zones and includes:
- **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)**
- **Ocean pH Levels**
- **Coral Bleaching Severity**
- **Species Observed**
- **Marine Heatwave Occurrence**

The data supports ecological monitoring, predictive modeling, and climate analysis efforts related to marine biodiversity and ocean health.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The dashboard aims to:
- Track climate-related changes in ocean temperature and acidity
- Understand the relationship between temperature, pH, and species diversity
- Highlight regional marine heatwave occurrences
- Support climate advocacy and ocean conservation initiatives through data
