# Data Science Job Posting Analysis Dashboard

This project is part of my **20-Day Power BI Dashboarding Challenge (Day 9)**.  
In this dashboard, I analyzed job postings for data science roles scraped from **Glassdoor** to understand salary trends, required skills, job titles, industry sectors, and job ratings across the market.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to provide data-driven insights into the data science job market, supporting job seekers, recruiters, and workforce planners by answering questions like:
- What are the highest-paying job titles and industries?
- What technical skills are in highest demand?
- Which sectors are hiring most actively?
- How do salaries and ratings vary across roles?
