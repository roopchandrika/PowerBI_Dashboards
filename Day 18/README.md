# 🌍 Global Food Wastage Analysis (2018–2024) – Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global food wastage trends from 2018 to 2024. Using categorized food waste data by country and economic loss, the dashboard is designed to help identify critical insights into sustainability gaps, economic inefficiencies, and household waste behavior.

## 📁 Dataset
- Data Span: 2018–2024
- Fields: Country, Year, Food Category, Total Waste (Tons), Population, Economic Loss ($), Per Capita Waste, Household Waste %

## 🧩 Key Dashboard Visuals
- **Total Waste (Tons)** and **Economic Loss (Million $)** – High-level global metrics
- **Food Category Breakdown (Donut Chart)** – Identifies leading sources of food waste (Prepared Food, Dairy, Beverages, etc.)
- **Economic Loss by Country (Map View)** – Visualizes the geographic impact of food wastage
- **Waste vs Economic Loss Scatterplot** – Correlation between food waste quantity and its economic consequences
- **Population vs Household Waste % by Category** – Understands behavior and demographic influence
- **Per Capita Waste** – Highlights average individual contribution to waste

## 🧠 Insights
- Prepared food and dairy products are among the top contributors to food wastage.
- Countries with higher populations tend to show higher economic losses, but not always proportionally.
- Average waste per person is ~109 kg globally, indicating the scale of behavioral opportunity.
- Strong correlation observed between household size, waste patterns, and economic loss.

## 💡 Business Use Case
This dashboard can be used by:
- **Policy Makers** to create targeted interventions in high-waste regions.
- **Sustainability Researchers** to identify trends in household and category-level food disposal.
- **NGOs and Food Networks** to develop educational and donation campaigns.
- **Retail and Food Industries** to optimize inventory, reduce spoilage, and plan efficient supply chains.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX for measures and KPIs**
- **Custom visuals and slicers** for interactivity
