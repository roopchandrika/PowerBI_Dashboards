# 🌍 Earthquake Analysis Dashboard (1900–2014)

This Power BI dashboard is part of my **20-Day Dashboarding Challenge (Day 14)**. It presents a comprehensive analysis of global earthquake activity from 1900 to 2014, focusing on magnitude, depth, location, and temporal patterns to uncover seismic trends and support geospatial decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Public earthquake data (1900–2014)
- **Records:** 8,313 earthquake events
- **Key Fields:** Date, Location, Depth (km), Magnitude, Magnitude Type

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze global seismic activity by year, month, location, and depth
- Identify magnitude and depth distributions
- Correlate spatial and temporal trends to support risk assessment
