# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard was developed as part of my **20-Day Power BI Dashboarding Challenge (Day 4)** to explore and visualize patterns in customer churn. Churn is a critical business metric indicating the percentage of customers who stop using a service over a period of time.

## 📌 Business Objective

The purpose of this dashboard is to help businesses:
- Identify at-risk customers
- Analyze churn across demographics and service usage
- Detect patterns in customer behavior and support interactions
- Empower marketing and support teams to implement proactive retention strategies

## 🔄 What is Customer Churn?

Customer Churn refers to when a customer ends their relationship or discontinues a service with a business. Monitoring churn is essential to understand customer dissatisfaction, improve service offerings, and ensure long-term profitability.
